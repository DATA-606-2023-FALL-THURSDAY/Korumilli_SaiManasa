# Background

Crime is a pervasive issue that affects communities, cities, and countries worldwide. Understanding crime patterns and trends is crucial for law enforcement agencies, policymakers, and communities to develop effective strategies for crime prevention and response. Analyzing historical crime data can provide valuable insights into the dynamics of criminal activity over time.

The period from 2010 to 2019 is particularly interesting for studying crime trends due to several societal and technological changes during this time.

### Data Source
- **Data Provider**: Los Angeles Police Department
- **Dataset Link**: [DataSet](https://data.lacity.org/Public-Safety/Crime-Data-from-2010-to-2019/63jg-8b9z)
- **Data Description**: This dataset reflects incidents of crime in the City of Los Angeles from 2010 - 2019. This data is transcribed from original crime reports that are typed on paper and therefore there may be some inaccuracies within the data. Some location fields with missing data are noted as (0°, 0°). Address fields are only provided to the nearest hundred block in order to maintain privacy. This data is as accurate as the data in the database. Please note questions or concerns in the comments.

## Project Objective
Here are concise project objectives for your analysis of crime data from 2010 to 2019:

1. Identify Trends: Analyze crime data to uncover long-term trends in crime rates over the decade.

2. Seasonal Patterns: Detect and explain any seasonal variations in crime occurrence.

3. Crime Categories: Examine the prevalence and changes in various crime categories.

4. Geospatial Analysis: Investigate high-crime areas and spatial patterns.

5. Demographics: Explore how demographic factors relate to crime rates.

6. Economic Influence: Assess the impact of economic conditions on crime.

7. Technology and Cybercrime: Study tech-related crime trends.

8. Policy Insights: Discuss findings' implications for policy and law enforcement.

9. Data Visualization: Create informative visuals for easy communication.

10. Public Safety: Strive to contribute to improved community safety

# Research Questions

Here are some research questions that you can use as a starting point for your analysis of crime data from 2010 to 2019:

1. What are the long-term trends in overall crime rates during the decade from 2010 to 2019, and are there significant variations from year to year?

2. Are there distinct seasonal patterns in crime occurrences, and if so, do these patterns vary by crime category (e.g., violent, property, drug-related)?

3. Which specific crime categories showed the most significant changes in prevalence over the study period, and can these changes be attributed to any specific factors or events?

4. Are there geographical hotspots for crime, and do these locations remain consistent over time? Are there areas that have experienced a notable increase or decrease in crime rates?

5. How do demographic factors, such as age, gender, and socioeconomic status, correlate with crime rates? Are certain demographic groups more susceptible to specific types of crimes?

6. To what extent do economic conditions, including periods of economic growth or recession, influence property crimes, financial crimes, and other criminal activities?

7. What are the emerging trends in technology-related crimes (e.g., cybercrimes) over the decade, and how have these offenses evolved with advancements in technology?

8. Can predictive models be developed to forecast future crime rates, and if so, which factors are the most influential in making accurate predictions?

9. What policy implications can be drawn from the analysis of crime data from 2010 to 2019? How can these findings inform law enforcement strategies and community safety initiatives?

10. How can data visualization techniques be used to effectively communicate the insights gained from the analysis of crime data, making the information accessible to a non-technical audience?
